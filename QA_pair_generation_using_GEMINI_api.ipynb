            "A: LLMs rely on static training data, resulting in outdated information, hallucinated responses, and an inability to adapt to dynamic, real-world scenarios.  This limitation necessitates systems that integrate real-time data and dynamically refine responses to maintain accuracy and contextual relevance.\n",

These agents use agentic design patterns (reflection, planning, tool use, multi-agent collaboration) to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows for complex tasks.  This surpasses traditional RAG's static workflows and improves flexibility, scalability, and context-awareness.\n",

            "A1: LLMs rely on static training data, resulting in outdated information, hallucinated responses, and an inability to adapt to dynamic, real-world scenarios.  This limitation necessitates systems that can integrate real-time data and dynamically refine responses to maintain contextual relevance and accuracy.\n",
            "Q2: What is Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG), and how does it improve upon traditional RAG?\n",
            "A2: Agentic RAG embeds autonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents utilize agentic design patterns (reflection, planning, tool use, multi-agent collaboration) to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows to complex tasks. This surpasses traditional RAG's limitations of static workflows and adaptability for multi-step reasoning.\n",
            "Q3: What are some key applications of Agentic RAG across various industries?\n",
            "A3: Agentic RAG finds applications in customer support (providing real-time, personalized responses), healthcare (integrating patient data with medical research for personalized medicine), finance (providing real-time insights for investment decisions and risk management), education (creating personalized learning experiences), and legal workflows (automating document analysis and risk assessment).  It also shows promise in creative industries and multimodal workflows.\n"
