Video files stored on a device\\nconnected to the TV via a Home Network may not play back smoothly.\\n\\nSome of the IEEE 802.11 communication protocols may not be supported depending on the model or geographical area.\\n\\nQN9**C/QN9**D Series supports the IEEE 802.11 a /b /g /n /ac /ax communication protocols.\\n\\nFor models other than the QN9**C/QN9**D Series, Samsung recommends using IEEE 802.11n.\\n\\n - To use wireless network, the TV must be connected to a wireless access point or modem. If the wireless access\\npoint supports DHCP, the TV can use a DHCP or static IP address to connect to the wireless network.\\n\\n - Select a channel that is not currently being used by the wireless access point. If the channel set is currently\\nbeing used by the wireless access point to communicate with another device, the result is usually interference or\\na communications failure.\\n\\n - Most wireless networks have an optional security system. To enable a wireless network\\'s security system, you\\nneed to create a password using characters and numbers. This password is then needed to connect to a securityenabled access point.\\n\\nWireless security protocols\\n\\nThe TV only supports the following wireless network security protocols. The TV cannot connect to non-certified\\nwireless access point.\\n\\n– Authentication Modes: WEP, WPAPSK, WPA2PSK\\n\\n– Encryption Types: WEP, TKIP, AES\\n\\nIn compliance with the Wi-Fi certification specifications, Samsung TVs do not support WEP or TKIP security\\nencryption in networks running in the 802.11n mode. If the wireless access point supports WPS (Wi-Fi Protected\\nSetup), you can connect the TV to your network using PBC (Push Button Configuration) or a PIN (Personal\\nIdentification Number). WPS automatically configures the SSID and WPA key settings.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n##### Read Before Playing Photo, Video or Music Files\\n\\nRead this information before playing media content.\\n\\n###### Limitations to the use of photo, video and music files Try Now\\n\\n - The TV supports MSC (Mass Storage Class) USB devices only. MSC is a class designation for mass storage devices.\\nTypes of MSC devices include external hard drives, flash card readers and digital cameras. (USB hubs are not\\nsupported.) These kinds of devices must be connected directly to the USB port. If a USB extension cable is used\\nor two external hard drives are used simultaneously, a USB device cannot be recognised or files contained in the\\ndevice cannot be read. Do not disconnect USB devices while they are transferring files.\\n\\n - When connecting an external hard drive, use the USB (HDD 5V 1A) port. We recommend that you use an external\\nhard drive with its own power adapter.\\n\\nOn models without the HDD 5V 1A marking, connect the drive to one of the USB (5V 1.0A/0.5A) ports.\\n\\nSome models do not support the HDD 5V 1A USB port. On such models that have 5V 1.0A and 5V 0.5A USB ports,\\n\\nconnect the drive to one of those ports.\\n\\n - Certain digital cameras and audio devices may not be compatible with the TV.\\n\\n - If there are multiple USB devices connected to the TV, the TV might not be able to recognise some or all the\\ndevices. USB devices that use high-power input should be connect to the USB (HDD 5V 1A) port.\\n\\nSome models do not support the HDD 5V 1A USB port. On such models that have 5V 1.0A and 5V 0.5A USB ports,\\n\\nconnect the drive to one of those ports.\\n\\n - The TV supports the FAT, exFAT and NTFS file systems.\\n\\n - In the media contents list, the TV can display up to 1,000 files per folder. If the USB device contains more than\\n8,000 files and folders, however, some files and folders might not be accessible.\\n\\n - Certain files, depending on how they are encoded, may not play on the TV.\\n\\n - Certain files are not supported on all models.\\n\\n - The DivX and DTS codecs are not supported by the Samsung TV models released in 2024.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### Supported subtitles\\n\\n|Subtitle formats|Col2|\\n|---|---|\\n|Name|Format|\\n|MPEG-4 Timed text|.ttxt|\\n|SAMI|.smi|\\n|SubRip|.srt|\\n|SubViewer|.sub|\\n|Micro DVD|.sub or .txt|\\n|SubStation Alpha|.ssa|\\n|Advanced SubStation Alpha|.ass|\\n|SMPTE-TT Text|.xml|\\n\\n|Video formats with subtitles|Col2|\\n|---|---|\\n|Name|Container|\\n|Xsub|AVI|\\n|SubStation Alpha|MKV|\\n|Advanced SubStation Alpha|MKV|\\n|SubRip|MKV|\\n|VobSub|MKV|\\n|MPEG-4 Timed text|MP4|\\n|TTML in smooth streaming|MP4|\\n|SMPTE-TT TEXT|MP4|\\n|SMPTE-TT PNG|MP4|\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### Supported image formats and resolutions\\n\\nFile extension Format Resolution\\n\\n*.jpg\\n\\nJPEG 16320 x 12240\\n\\n*.jpeg\\n\\n*.png PNG 4096 x 4096\\n\\n*.bmp BMP 4096 x 4096\\n\\n*.mpo MPO 15360 x 8640\\n\\n*.heic HEIF 16320 x 12240\\n\\nThe MPO format is supported partly.\\n\\nThe HEIF format is may not be supported depending on the model or geographical area.\\n\\nHEIF supports only the single image of grid type (grid) and its minimum resolution must be at least 512 pixels in width or\\n\\nheight.\\n\\n###### Supported music formats and codecs\\n\\n|File extension|Format|Resolution|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|*.jpg *.jpeg|JPEG|16320 x 12240|\\n|*.png|PNG|4096 x 4096|\\n|*.bmp|BMP|4096 x 4096|\\n|*.mpo|MPO|15360 x 8640|\\n|*.heic|HEIF|16320 x 12240|\\n\\n|File extension|Format|Codec|Note|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|*.mp3|MPEG|MPEG1 Audio Layer 3||\\n|*.m4a *.mpa *.aac|MPEG4|AAC||\\n|*.falc|FLAC|FLAC|Supports up to 16/24 Bit, 48/96/192 kHz, 5.1 channel|\\n|*.ogg|OGG|Vorbis|Supports up to 2 channels|\\n|*.wma|WMA|WMA|WMA is supported up to 10 Pro 5.1 channels.

Look for the lock slot on the\\nback of the TV. The slot has a icon next to it. To use the lock, wrap the lock cable around an object that is too\\nheavy to carry and then thread it through the TV\\'s lock slot. The lock is sold separately. The method of using an antitheft lock may differ for each model.

            "    *   **A:** Go to (left directional button) `Settings` > `Support` > `Software Update` > `Update Now`. The TV will check for available updates via the network or USB.\n",
            "*   **Q: How often should I update my TV's software?**\n",
            "    *   **A:** It's generally recommended to keep your TV updated whenever updates are available. This ensures you have the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches.\n",

            "    *   **A:** The user guide itself does not contain a detailed version history. Samsung typically provides this information on their support website: www.samsung.com. Search for your specific TV model number and look for the \"Downloads\" or \"Software\" section.\n",

It *may* be possible in some cases through unofficial methods, but proceed with extreme caution as it could potentially brick your TV. Search online forums specific to your TV model to see if any user has succeeded in rolling back the software.\n",

By leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) like Google's Gemini, we can transform dense technical documentation into a readily accessible knowledge base.
