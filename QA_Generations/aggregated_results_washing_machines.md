*   Do not move the washing machine without the shipping bolts in place.
*   Packaging materials can be dangerous to children. Dispose of all packaging material (plastic bags, polystyrene, etc.) out of children’s reach.

## Guide 2: Leveling the Washing Machine

**Objective:** Ensure the washing machine is level for proper operation.

**Tools:**
*   Spanner (supplied with washing machine)
*   Level (optional)

**Time Estimate:** 10-20 minutes

**Steps:**

1.  **Adjust Levelling Feet:** Manually adjust the levelling feet to raise or lower each corner of the washing machine.
    *Time: 5-10 minutes*
2.  **Check Level:** Use a level (if available) to confirm the washing machine is level on all sides. Visually inspect if a level is not available. Ensure all feet are seated on the floor.
     *Time: 2-3 minutes*
3.  **Tighten Nuts:** Once the washing machine is level, tighten the nuts on the levelling feet using the spanner to secure them in place.
    *Time: 3-5 minutes*

**Important Notes:**
* Ensure leveling feet are not pressing against the power cord.
*   Make sure all the levelling feet are seating on the floor surface to avoid the washing machine from moving or generating noise due to vibration. Then, check if the washing machine is rocking. If the washing machine is not rocking, tighten the nuts.

## Guide 3: Cleaning the Debris Filter

**Objective:** Clean the debris filter to prevent clogging and maintain optimal washing performance.

**Tools:**
*   Soft brush
*   Container to collect water
*   Waste bin

**Time Estimate:** 15-25 minutes

4.  **Clean Filter:** Clean the debris filter using a soft brush, discarding any debris into the waste bin.  Rinse the filter and make sure the drain pump propeller inside the filter is unclogged.
    *Time: 5-7 minutes*

5.  **Reinsert Filter:** Reinsert the debris filter and turn the filter knob to the right to tighten.
    *Time: 2-3 minutes*

6.  **Close Filter Cover:** Close the filter cover.
    *Time: 1 minute*

**Important Notes:**
*   The "Clean drain filter" message appears on the control panel display after every 100 washes.

## Feature Explanation

Okay, I've reviewed the washing machine manual you provided. Here's a breakdown of the Samsung technologies mentioned or implied, with technical specs, use cases, and compatibility notes derived from the text.

It's important to understand that this is based *solely* on the information provided in *this particular manual*.  Actual features and specifications will vary widely by model. Also note that I have no current access to the internet so I can't cross-reference these technologies with current Samsung offerings.

**1. Ecobubble (Implied, Through features such as "Intense Cold")**

*   **Technical Specs:**  Not directly specified in the document, but generally involves generating bubbles from detergent and air before the water enters the drum.
*   **Use Cases:**  Improving washing performance, particularly in cold water, by helping detergent penetrate fabrics more effectively. The "Intense Cold" cycle specifically aims to reduce power consumption by leveraging Ecobubble's efficiency at low temperatures.
*   **Compatibility Notes:**  Likely works best with liquid detergents.  May be less effective with powdered detergents that don't dissolve easily.

**2. AI Wash (Applicable Models Only)**

*   **Technical Specs:**  Analyzes the load and soil level to automatically adjust the cycle parameters and detergent dispensing.
*   **Use Cases:**  Simplifies the washing process by removing guesswork. Aims to optimize cleaning performance while saving water and detergent.
*   **Compatibility Notes:**  Best used with the Auto Dispense feature and liquid detergents.

**3. Auto Dispense (Implied, Through "Dispenser 1" and "Dispenser 2" features)**

*   **Technical Specs:** Automatic dispensers for liquid detergent and fabric softener. Adjustable dispensing amounts to suit different load sizes and soil levels.
*   **Use Cases:** Convenience of not having to manually add detergent and softener for each load. Precise detergent dosing can improve wash results and reduce detergent waste.
*   **Compatibility Notes:** Only works with liquid detergents and fabric softeners. Requires proper maintenance (cleaning the dispensers regularly) to prevent clogging.

**4. QuickDrive (Applicable Models Only)**

*   **Technical Specs:**  Technology aimed at reducing the overall washing time.
*   **Use Cases:**  For when you need clothes washed faster.
*   **Compatibility Notes:**  May not be available for all cycles or when the temperature is set to 90°C.

**5. Hygiene Steam**

*   **Technical Specs:** Uses steam during the wash cycle.
*   **Use Cases:** Allergy care and bacteria elimination. For optimal hygiene results, select a temperature of 60°C or above.
*   **Compatibility Notes:** Intended for cotton and linen fabrics that have been in direct contact with the skin, such as underwear.

**6. SmartThings Integration/Smart Control (Applicable Models Only)**

*   **Technical Specs:**  Connects the washing machine to a Wi-Fi network, allowing remote control via the Samsung SmartThings app on a smartphone or tablet. Requires a Samsung account.
*   **Use Cases:**  Start, stop, and monitor the washing machine remotely. Receive notifications about cycle status. Access additional cycle options or settings not available on the washing machine's control panel.
*   **Compatibility Notes:** Requires a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network.  Requires the SmartThings app (available on Android and iOS).

**7. Drum Clean+/Drum Clean**

*   **Technical Specs:** A high-temperature cycle designed to clean the washing machine drum.
*   **Use Cases:** Maintaining hygiene by removing dirt and bacteria from the drum. Prevents odors and extends the life of the washing machine.
*   **Compatibility Notes:** Should be run every 40 washes.  Do not use detergent or bleach during the cycle.

**8. AI Pattern**

*   **Technical Specs:** The washing machine learns the frequently used cycles and settings (Temp., Rinse, Spin) and displays them in frequency order.
*   **Use Cases:** Simplifies the washing process by making the frequently used cycles readily accessible.
*   **Compatibility Notes:** Function can be turned on or off. When you turn off the function, all the saved data resets.

**General Technical Specifications (Applicable to all models, but values vary)**

*   **Power:** AC 220-240V / 50Hz
*   **Water Pressure:** 50-1000 kPa
*   **Spin Speed:** Up to 1400 RPM (depending on model)
*   **Maximum Load Capacity:** 9kg or 11kg (depending on model)

**Important Notes from the Manual:**

*   **Safety First:** The manual emphasizes numerous safety precautions related to electrical connections, water supply, and usage. These should be carefully followed.
*   **Installation:** Proper installation is crucial for performance and safety. It's recommended to have a qualified technician install the machine.
