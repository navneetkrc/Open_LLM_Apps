*   **Accuracy:** The solutions are based solely on the provided text. A real-world solution might require further diagnosis.

This list is not exhaustive, but it captures a range of problems and solutions from the user guide. Remember to consult the full user guide for complete details.

## Step-by-Step

Okay, I'll generate step-by-step procedural guides based on the provided text. I'll focus on procedures that involve specific tools or have a clear sequence of actions.  I'll estimate the time required for each step where appropriate.

**Note:** Since the document is a user guide and not a repair manual, the procedures will be based on user-level tasks, not hardware repairs. I'll assume basic computer and mobile phone proficiency. Times are estimates and will vary based on the user's experience and network speed.

**I. Transferring Data from a Previous Device (Smart Switch)**

**Description:** Transfer data from an old phone to the new device using Smart Switch.

**Tools:**

*   USB cable (optional, for wired transfer)
*   Previous device (Android or iOS)
*   New Samsung device

**Steps:**

1.  **Open Smart Switch:** On your new Samsung device, navigate to Settings > Accounts and backup > Transfer data for device setup. **(Time Estimate: 15 seconds)**
2.  **Choose Transfer Method:** Select "Wireless" or "Cable" based on your preference and the available tools. **(Time Estimate: 5 seconds)**
3.  **Old Device Setup (if needed):**
    *   **Wireless:** On your old device, download and install the Smart Switch app from the Play Store or App Store. Open the app and follow the prompts. **(Time Estimate: 5-10 minutes for download and setup)**
    *   **Cable:** Connect the old device to the new Samsung device using the USB cable. **(Time Estimate: 10 seconds)**
4.  **Establish Connection:** Follow the on-screen instructions to establish a connection between the devices. This may involve granting permissions or entering a code. **(Time Estimate: 1-2 minutes)**
5.  **Select Data to Transfer:** Choose the categories of data you want to transfer (contacts, messages, photos, etc.). **(Time Estimate: 1 minute)**
6.  **Start Transfer:** Initiate the data transfer process.  The time this takes depends on the amount of data being transferred. **(Time Estimate: 10 minutes - 1 hour depending on data size)**
7.  **Review Transferred Data:** After the transfer is complete, verify that the data has been transferred successfully. **(Time Estimate: 5-10 minutes)**

**II. Downloading an eSIM**

**Description:** Downloading and activating an eSIM on a compatible Samsung device.

**Tools:**

## Error Codes

Okay, here's a breakdown of how to interpret error codes based on the user manual, and how to respond to them. Because this document is a *user guide*, it doesn't directly list specific error codes. Instead, it provides general troubleshooting advice and identifies situations that *could* lead to errors. I'll extrapolate from those situations to suggest possible error codes and what actions to take.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **No Specific Error Codes:** As stated above, user guides *rarely* include exhaustive error code lists. These are more typically found in service manuals or developer documentation. The following are *inferred* error conditions.
*   **Service Triggers:** These indicate situations where the user cannot fix the problem and needs professional assistance.
*   **Immediate Actions:** These are steps the user can take *right now* to try and resolve the problem.

**Scenario-Based Error Code Interpretation and Actions**

Here are some examples, based on the manual's contents:

**1. Network/Connectivity Problems**

*   **Possible Error Code (Inferred):**  `NET_001` (Generic Network Error), `WIFI_001` (Wi-Fi Connection Failure), `SIM_001` (SIM Card Error)
*   **Triggering Situations (From Manual):**
    *   "Connectivity problems and battery drain may occur...If you attach metallic stickers on the antenna area..."
    *   "If you use the wireless charger in areas with weak network signals, you may lose network reception."
    *   "Using both the nano-SIM card and the eSIM, or two eSIMs may result in slower data transfer speeds in some areas."
    *   "When you are in areas with weak signals or poor reception, you may lose reception."
*   **Immediate Actions:**
    *   Remove metallic stickers or cases.
    *   Move to an area with a stronger network signal.
    *   Check SIM card placement (if applicable).
    *   Restart the device.

*   **Immediate Actions:**
    *   Close running apps.
    *   Stop using the device for a while.
    *   Remove the device from direct sunlight or hot environments.
    *   Ensure the device is not covered or obstructed.
*   **Service Triggers:**
    *   Frequent overheating even with minimal use.
    *   Warning messages about overheating persist.
    *   Device shuts down due to overheating and cannot be restarted until it cools down significantly.

**5. Freezing/Unresponsive Device**

*   **Possible Error Code (Inferred):** `SYS_001` (System Freeze), `APP_001` (Application Crash)
*   **Triggering Situations (From Manual):**
    *   "If your device freezes or hangs..."
*   **Immediate Actions:**
    *   Close apps.
    *   Force restart the device (hold Power and Volume Down for 7 seconds).
*   **Service Triggers:**
    *   Frequent freezes requiring force restarts.
    *   Inability to perform a factory reset through the device settings.

**General Troubleshooting Steps (Regardless of the Specific Error)**

The user guide emphasizes these steps, so they're relevant across multiple scenarios:

*   **Restart the device:** This clears temporary software glitches.
*   **Ensure software is up to date:** Samsung regularly releases updates that address bugs and improve performance.
*   **Free up storage space:** Insufficient storage can cause various problems.
*   **Use Samsung-approved accessories:** Incompatible chargers or cables can cause charging issues or even damage the device.
*   **Factory data reset:** As a last resort, but remember to back up data first.
*   **Visit a Samsung Service Center:** If the problem persists, it likely requires professional attention.

**How to Present Error Information to the User**

When an error occurs, the device should:

1.  **Display a clear and concise error message:**  "Network error (NET_001). Please check your connection." (Example)
2.  **Suggest immediate actions:** "Try moving to an area with a stronger signal, or restart your device."
3.  **Indicate if service is needed:** "If the problem continues, contact Samsung support."
4.  **Provide a link to a help topic:** "Learn more: samsung.com/support/networkerrors"

**Important Considerations for Error Code Design:**

*   **Hierarchy:** Use a hierarchical structure (e.g., `NET_001`, `NET_002`, `NET_003`) to categorize errors.
*   **Meaningful Codes:**  Make the codes somewhat descriptive (e.g., `NET` for network, `BAT` for battery).
*   **Logging:** The device should log these error codes for diagnostic purposes (accessible to service technicians).
*   **Localization:** Error messages and help topic links should be localized for different regions.

This framework should help you design and interpret error codes in the context of the SM-S931B series devices, based on the information provided in the user guide. Remember that a service manual would be necessary for a complete picture.

    *   **A:** If you begin to feel uncomfortable because of the device overheating, stop using the device.
*   **Q: What happens if my device overheats?**
    *   **A:** If the device overheats, the screen brightness, the screen refresh rate, and the performance speed will be limited to lower the device’s temperature. Even if the battery charging indicator icon appears, charging may be slow. When charging stops because of a rise in the device’s temperature, the battery indicator icon will blink.
*   **Q: What message will appear if the device overheats?**
    *   **A:** If the device reaches a certain temperature, a warning message will appear to prevent device failure, skin irritation and damage, and battery leakage. Running apps will be closed and all calling and other features will be limited, except for emergency calls, until the device cools down.
*   **Q: What happens if the device continues to overheat after the warning?**
    *   **A:** If the second message appears because of a further increase of the device’s temperature, the device will turn off. Do not use the device until the device’s temperature is within the recommended operating temperature range. If the second warning message appears during an emergency call, the call will not be disconnected by a forced termination.

**Compliance Standards**
